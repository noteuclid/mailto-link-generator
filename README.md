# mailto: Link generator
This app generates `mailto:` links (link that launch email handlers with pre-configured values for the default recipient, subject line, etc.) It is a web app written to work in a browser.

## Usage 
You can use this app by downloading the source code ZIP and double-clicking the *mailtogenerator.html* file. You can also use it at my website, https://noteuclid.com/mailtogenerator.html.

## Instructions
In each box, type out what you want the default email values to be, then click 'Generate'. You can then actually run the link you made, or (more practically) you can copy the link for use in your own website or email.
